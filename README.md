The project revolves around minimizing the cost of the rocket projection with the use of multi-variable calculus. First, the math will be formulated based on our general understanding of physics regarding the subject. Then we will solve the mathematics part using Lagrange multipliers and the calculus thus taught to us.

## Problem Statement

In rocket projection optimizing staging is very crucial for increasing efficiency, reducing cost, and enhancing payload capacity. The aim of solving this problem is to formulate an efficient staging process using calculus by deriving equations for optimizing payload capacity. The purpose of optimization is to obtain the best possible performance in terms of fuel economy, weight distribution, and overall mission success.

## Formulation and Solving of Mathematics

The formulation of Mathematics is done by use of basic Mechanics and Multivariable Calculus (Lagrange's Multiplier). 

In ideal cases, the final velocity of a rocket is calculated by the formula shown below derived from the concept of **Conservation of Momentum**.

But this equation is for ideal cases. If we think of a more realistic approach towards multiple-stage rocket launching, we get the following equations.

On further solving we can derive **minimum gross lift-off mass**
