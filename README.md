The project revolves around minimizing the cost of the rocket projection with the use of multi-variable calculus. First, the math will be formulated based on our general understanding of physics regarding the subject. Then we will solve the mathematics part using Lagrange multipliers and the calculus thus taught to us.

## Problem Statement

In rocket projection optimizing staging is very crucial for increasing efficiency, reducing cost, and enhancing payload capacity. The aim of solving this problem is to formulate an efficient staging process using calculus by deriving equations for optimizing payload capacity. The purpose of optimization is to obtain the best possible performance in terms of fuel economy, weight distribution, and overall mission success.
