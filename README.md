# Rocket Staging Optimization.

The project revolves around minimizing the cost of the rocket project with the use of multi variable calculus. First the math will be formulated on the basis of our general understanding of physics regarding the subject. Then we will solve the mathematics part using Lagrange multipliers and the calculus thus taught to us.
